# Axios vs native 'fetch' compatibility test suite

## How to use

- The test suite can be run both in browser & node environments.
- Browser version is run using Karma/Jasmine.
- Node version is run by Jest.
- Test syntax is limited to Jasmine & Jest compatible subset.
- To switch between Axios and Fetch use a hardcoded 'isFetch' variable in the '.spec' file.
- To run the test suite first run the echo server: 'npm run echo-server'.
